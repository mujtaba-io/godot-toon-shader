# Toon Shader for Godot

This is my attempt at a cel shader using Godot 4.6 made for [godot toon shader](https://gameidea.org/2024/02/15/toon-cel-shader/) tutorial. I made this shader in its primitive form 2 years ago, but decided to update it and make it more ready for usage.

Hope you'll find it helpful.
